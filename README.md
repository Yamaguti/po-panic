# The Game
Here's a link to a live version of the game:
    https://www.linux.ime.usp.br/~akio/game-jam/tappsgamejam2016/

##Running locally
    There's a python script in the root folder of the project. It sets a local server to host the game on port 8000 and starts a browser tab with the game running. To use it, simply run the script by right clicking the file `startgame.py` on windows, and on MAC and Linux by typing in the terminal python startgame.py
